I'm originally from Natrona Heights, PA and currently live in New York City with my dog Roo. My personal interests include hiking, urban cycling, American traditional tattooing, the New York City public park system, and trail running (here's my [favorite hometown race](https://rachelcarsontrails.org/), which connects Rachel Carson's childhood home to mine- cool!).
