### Principles
The following principles guide my work:
<ul><li><b> ["Health is a human right. The public health community exists to safeguard that right."](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/about/mission-history/public-health-oath#:~:text=I%20will%20hold%20myself%20to,communities%20with%20whom%20I%20work.) Public health research must aim to create a more just and equitable world. </b> </li>
<li> Sharing reproduction achives and statistical code & producing publicly available datasets (when appropriate) to create a more rigorous and inclusive scientific environment. </li>

<li> Supporting and advocating for [data soverignty](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32251390) for indigenous people and nations.</li>

<li> Supporting and mentoring the next generation of scientists and public health professionals, from high school through graduate school, to create a more just, equitable, and inclusive scientific environment.</li>

<li> [Naming and describing](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200630.939347/full/) how institutional, structural, and interpersonal racism, classism, misogyny, xenophobia, & transphobia operate to impact health and cause disease.</li></ul>




### Personal
I'm originally from Natrona Heights, PA and currently live in New York City with my dog Roo. My personal interests include hiking, urban cycling, the New York City public park system, and trail running (here's my [favorite hometown trail system](https://rachelcarsontrails.org/)).
